Week 1
Instructor: Mei Chan
Let there be two characters: Player and Monster. Each of these characters have a name and a number of health points, such as 100 life points, and must be stored in separate variables. These two characters will fight against each other. A character, be it the player or the monster, will be considered “dead’ if their health point reaches zero. 

Each turn, the player will be presented a set of options (consider it a menu) that will appear at the start of each turn: 1) Attack, 2) Defend. The player has to input which option they choose. 

If the player decides to attack the monster, decrease the health of the monster by a constant amount of points (the amount is to your choosing). If the player decides to defend, the player’s health does not decrease as much, but the monster’s health does not change either.

After each turn, the monster will attack the player and the attack will decrease the player’s health. The game will end when one of the characters are dead. If the player's health reaches zero, the player loses and the console window will display “You lose!” and end the game. If the monster’s health reaches zero, the player wins and the console window will display “You win!” and end the game.
